## Used Libraries in a project 
   - ### **Locksmith**. 
        User-friendly wrapper over Keychain. In order not to spend a lot of time writing code to work with Keychain, I decided to use this library
   - ### **SkyfloatingLabelTextField**.
     Since for me a beautiful and user-friendly design in any project is a priority, I decided to use these textfields
